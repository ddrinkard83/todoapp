# Dave's Super Tight Todo App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I made this and I think it's pretty slick.

## How it works

Type in your task at the top, and hit Add Task. You will receive an alert if you try to submit nothing!

Click on the task to toggle the task as completed.

Click on delete to remove the task.

Click on edit to modify the task, you will be prompted to type in something and hit submit.
